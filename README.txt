Purpose: I'm practicing with R and git. I pulled an Excel file from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting System containing
	violent crime statistics by Metropolitan area. My intention is to wrangle the data into a usable form. Then, 
	analyze the data for various crime types and determine if the crime rate distribution across metro areas is 
	normally distributed. If so, determine which metropolitan areas are 2 or more standard deviations above the mean.
	Then, after removing those, or perhaps the top few, areas, compare the US crime rate in various categories with other
	countries.
Files: Need to fill this out.
